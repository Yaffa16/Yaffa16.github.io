  <p>
    Meme Me is a playful yet critical installation that blurs the line between
    automated image recognition and internet culture. The work explores how
    artificial intelligence interprets visual content and repackages it into
    the internet’s most potent form of commentary: memes. In an age when
    screenshots, selfies, and social media posts form a vast visual archive
    of digital life, Meme Me reclaims this mundane visual material and feeds
    it through a chain of AI perception and language generation—
    ultimately producing a meme that is both absurd and unsettlingly
    accurate. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    The process is deceptively simple:
    <ol>
      <li>Screenshot Capture — passive capture at intervals or through interaction.</li>
      <li>Visual Analysis — image frames are analyzed using a multimodal vision-language model.</li>
      <li>Text Generation — the model crafts short, meme-typical captions.</li>
      <li>Meme Creation — OpenCV overlays text on the original image in classic meme format.</li>
    </ol>
    Each step combines machine vision, natural language generation, and code
    to co‑create memes with both humor and unsettling accuracy. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

  <h2>Yasha Jain’s Role</h2>
  <p>
    Yasha Jain conceptualized and implemented the entire Meme Me pipeline,
    including integrating the multimodal model via Ollama, customizing prompts
    for balanced humor and absurdity, and building the OpenCV overlay system for
    real‑time meme generation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
