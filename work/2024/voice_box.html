  <p>
    The Voicebox is a pioneering interactive installation that merges
    artificial intelligence, voice‑cloning technology, and generative
    storytelling to create personalized, ephemeral audio narratives.
    At the intersection of human expression and machine authorship,
    The Voicebox invites visitors to experience the uncanny sensation
    of hearing themselves perform in AI‑generated radio plays—narratives
    they did not write, yet star in. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Participants step into an enclosed recording booth outfitted with
    high‑fidelity microphones and an intuitive user interface. Upon entering,
    visitors are prompted to record a short vocal sample—typically a 30‑60
    second passage of text, or spontaneous speech. This audio serves as the
    raw material for a multi‑stage generative process that transforms the
    participant’s voice into the central performance of a bespoke,
    machine‑written radio play. Within minutes, participants are presented
    with a surreal, professionally‑mixed radio drama featuring their own
    voice acting out characters, emotions, and dialogue—all orchestrated by
    AI. Each resulting piece is ephemeral: once played, the audio file is
    discarded, underscoring the installation's themes of impermanence and
    authorship. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

  <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    While the full system is complex, at its core:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Voice capture and preprocessing:</b> High‑quality audio capture with noise reduction.</li>
      <li><b>Voice cloning engine:</b> Neural synthesis creates a clone capable of expressive performance.</li>
      <li><b>Narrative generation:</b> Transformer‑based language models generate coherent scripts.</li>
      <li><b>Voice synthesis and sound design:</b> The cloned voice performs the narrative with ambient audio layers.</li>
      <li><b>Playback:</b> Participants hear an immersive, ephemeral audio output. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Conceptual Themes</h2>
  <p>
    The installation asks layered questions about authorship, identity,
    and creative agency in the age of AI. It explores how machines can
    appropriate human expression while forcing participants to confront
    their own voice as both source material and subject. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
