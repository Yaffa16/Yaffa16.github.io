<!-- Project Description -->
<p>
AI Tell You / You Tell Me is an interactive media installation that questions
the authority of interpretation in art. As museums and cultural institutions
increasingly adopt algorithmic tools to describe and organize their collections,
this work confronts a central question:
<strong>Who owns the truth when artificial intelligence becomes the voice of meaning?</strong> :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>
A selection of original artworks from the ZKM collection hang on the walls,
each accompanied by a small Raspberry Pi‑powered screen. Instead of fixed
museum labels, these screens display AI‑generated interpretations—uniquely
tailored for each visitor. Visitors receive an RFID tag and go to an
interaction station where they answer philosophical, aesthetic, and emotional
questions. Based on these inputs, the system selects one of 16 conceptual
themes such as nostalgia, hyper‑capitalism, utopia, or paranoia. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
</p>

<h2>Technical Write‑Up</h2>
<p>
The AI system integrates custom‑trained vision models that extract semantic
features from artworks and produce text aligned with the selected theme.
A theme‑selection engine dynamically maps visitor input to narrative filters
that generate interpretations that are both technically sound and
philosophically provocative. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
AI Tell You / You Tell Me explores the consequences of turning interpretive
power over to machines—especially in institutions trusted as custodians of
cultural knowledge. By making viewers co‑authors of meaning, it invites
reflection on how truth is shaped in the age of AI. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
